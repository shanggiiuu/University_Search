/**
 * Registration and login.
 *
 * <p><b>Rule number one of authentication: never store passwords.</b> Store a
 * hash. A hash is a one-way transformation — easy to compute forwards, effectively
 * impossible to reverse — so if somebody steals your database they still cannot log
 * in as your users. To check a password later you hash the attempt and compare the
 * hashes; you never decrypt anything, because there is nothing to decrypt.
 *
 * <p>{@link BCryptPasswordEncoder} does this properly for you. Two details worth
 * knowing:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>It mixes in a random <b>salt</b> per password, so two users with the same
 *       password get different hashes and an attacker cannot spot the pattern.</li>
 *   <li>It is deliberately <b>slow</b>, which makes brute-force guessing expensive.
 *       This is why you must not use fast hashes like MD5 or SHA-1 for passwords.</li>
 * </ul>
 * Because the salt is stored inside the hash string, you must compare with
 * {@code passwordEncoder.matches(raw, storedHash)} — comparing with
 * {@code equals()} will never match.
